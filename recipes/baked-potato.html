        <p><h3>Baked Potato How-To</h3>
            The following recipe is for making a baked potato. Please use all the indredients and follow all the instructions below for a delicious baked potato!
        </p><br>

        <p><h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 large russet potatoes</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil (or avocado oil)</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <p><h3>Instructions:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit. You can line a pan with parchment paper or aluminum foil lightly oiled if you prefer.</li>
            <li>Scrub the potatoes clean with cold water. Using a brush designed for produce can help to make sure any dirt is removed from the potatoes, but you can use your hands or a paper towel as well to scrub.</li>
            <li>Pat the potato dry with towels, you want the potatoes to be as dry as possible. No soggy potatoes or it's harder to make crispy oven potatoes.</li>
            <li>Prick each potato with a fork so you poke holes piercing the skin. Aim for picking the potatoes five to six times, spacing them out all over the potatoes.</li>
            <li>Brush the outside of the potato with olive oil, then sprinkle generously with salt. Use a coarser, flakey sea salt if you have it!</li>
            <li>Place the potatoes on a sheet pan in a single layer. Bake the potatoes for about an hour (sixty minutes.) A paring knife or fork should slide into the potato easily when finished cooking. If the center of the potato still feels hard when you poke it, put it back in the oven, checking about every ten minutes or so until done.</li>
            <li>Slice the top of each potato and fluff the inside with a fork a little bit. Then add your favorite toppings and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
