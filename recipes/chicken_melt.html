                    <p>PATTIES<br>
                    - 1 1/2 pounds ground chicken<br>
                    - 1/3 cup dried bread crumbs<br>
                    - 1 teaspoon dried cumin<br>
                    - 1 teaspoon granulated onion <strong>powder (not salt)</strong><br>
                    - 1 teaspoon kosher salt<br>
                    - 1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper<br><br>
                    </p>
                    <p>ONIONS<br>
                    - 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil<br>
                    - 2 medium-sized yellow onions, each cut in half and then thinly sliced<br>
                    - 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme<br>
                    - 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt<br>
                    - 1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper<br><br>
                    
                    - 2 slices of rye bread about 1/2 inch thick (per pattie)<br>
                    - 3 tablespoon of unsalted butter (for toasting rye bread)<br>
                    - 2 slices of cheddar cheese per pattie
                    </p><br>

                    <p>INSTRUCTIONS<br>
                    1. In a large skillet over medium-high heat, warm the oil. Add the onions and <strong>onion</strong> ingredients until onions are slightly caramelized and tender. Remove from heat.<br><br>

                    2. Mix the <strong>patty</strong> ingredients, and then form four patties of equal size, each about 1 inch thick. With your thumb or the back of a spoon, make a shallow indentation about 1 inch wide in the center of the patties. This is to prevent the patties from forming a dome as they cook. Refrigerate the patties until ready to grill.<br><br>
                    
                    3. Prepare the grill for direct cooking over medium-high heat (400&#8457 to 500&#8457).<br><br>

                    4. On a work surface, butter one side of each of the rye bread slices. Flip the bread slices over, butter-side down onto the work surface. On one of the slices with non-butter side facing up, place a slice of cheese and top it with a generous amount of caramelized onions. This slice will serve as the bottom slice of the chicken melt.<br><br>
                    
                    5. Grill the patties over direct medium-high heat, with the lid closed, until <strong>FULLY</strong> cooked to <strong>(165&#8457) for a total of 8 to 10 minutes</strong>. Flip only ONCE halfway through cooking time.<br>
                    <strong>Note: Chicken patties and chicken in general should be fully cooked. Fully-cooked meat will depend on thickness of the patty, heat of grill, distance of the patty from the direct heat of the grill, and other factors.  Please adjust cooking times accordingly.</strong><br>
                    <strong>For additional cooking times, doneness, and health warnings click <a href="../addi_cook_info.html">here.</a></strong><br><br>

                    6. Once patties are cooked, place each patty on top of the prepared bottom rye bread slice with onions and cheese. Place another slice of cheese on top of the cooked chicken patty and place the top rye bread slice on top. The buttered side of the top bread slice should be facing outside/outward the chicken melt.<br><br>

                    7. Place entire chicken melt back into the grill and toast each side of the melt until cheese is melted and bread is toasted. Flip only once per side. Once both sides are done, remove melt from grill and...<br><br>

                    8. ENJOY!!!
