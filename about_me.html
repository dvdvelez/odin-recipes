            <p>First of all I want to thank every person who has taken a bit of time from their busy day in visiting my very first website!!!<br><br>
                
            This website is my very first website in which I am applying the knowledge I have learned concerning html and css coding. It has been fun but very challenging at the same time. However, I have finally finished and completed this website and am ready to move on the next phase in web development: javascript!<br><br>
            
            I want to thank all the content creators and give credit to them for helping me create this website. None of the content found on this website is meant to be the beginning of any business nor is any of the content found within meant to be monetized in some form or manner. I will thus NOT accept any sort of monetary compensation for any of the content found within nor will I include any ads of any sort in this website with the intention of generating any sort of financial earnings.<br><br>
            
            This website is wholly meant to be my first complete webpage project whereby I can showcase what I have learned thus far in my coding journey. As I progress forward I will continue to edit this website and its content so that I can solidify the things that I am learning.<br><br>
            
            Again, thank you to all the content creators listed in the credits page and lastly but not least I want to thank The Odin Project and everyone who has made this opensource possible. May all of you continue to be successful in everything you do and may you continue to make The Odin Project free and accessible to everyone who is willing to learn something new and potentially change their lives around. Sincerely, the most profound thank you to everyone at The Odin Project for providing all this wonderful knowledge and content free of charge to everyone out there and I will continue to let everyone know about The Odin Project and its awesome service to the entire world!<br><br><br>
            

            THANK YOU!!!<br><br>
