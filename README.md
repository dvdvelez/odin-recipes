# odin-recipes

This is the readme file for my new odin-recipes webpage.
I hope to employ some basic tags like "br" and "p" and also use ordered and unordered lists.
Also, I plan to learn the basics of add, commit, and push git commands.

<!--Editing: Adding the information below to readme-->
I am editing the readme file to see the changes in github.
