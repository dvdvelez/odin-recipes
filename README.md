# odin-recipes

This is the readme file for my new odin-recipes webpage.
I hope to employ some basic tags like "br" and "p" and also use ordered and unordered lists.
Also, I plan to learn the basics of add, commit, and push git commands.

<!--Editing: Adding the information below to readme-->
I am editing the readme file to see the changes in github.

<!--Editing: Further editing readme file-->
I am further editing the readme file to continue practicing git commit messages.

<!--Editing: One last edit to the readme file-->
This is one last edit to the readme file...for now!

<!--Editing: Re-editing and changing original webpage-->
After learning CSS basics and fundamentals, I have decided to completely change my recipes webpage to focus on different types of burger recipes.
